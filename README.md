My name is Kelsey Beaulieu and I am 20 years old. I graduated from General Amherst high school and went straight to the university of Windsor for Political Science. I orignally wanted to go into Graphic Design although i was told by my uncle who is a graphic design in Toronto that it would not be wise since he said it is a dying industry. After 5 weekes of being at the university I realized I wasn't happy learning political science and I knew I definitely did not fit in. Therefore I dropped out and decided I was going to pursue my original plan by registering in Graphic Design at St Clair. I worked multiple jobs for the year I was off to gain money to afford everything and by the time next september came I was extremely excited to be starting this program. My uncle will continue to say that he tried discouraging me from graphics although just being in this program has showed me it is not a dying industry, in fact it is a rising industry with the new technologies we have.
Other than my education, I have four sisters, three older and one younger. I have a boyfriend who I have been dating for 2 years and I live in McGregor.
